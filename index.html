                        Hello! My name is Lukasz Dworakowski (as you can probably tell from me pasting it all over the place), and I am currently a student at the University of Toronto Mississauga studying Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics.
			My main passions in the fields I study are an obsession with numbers, and how they work. Patterns we may find, and funny coincidences that happen along the way! I believe that there will be some sort of major break through in the 
			    field of Computer Science fairly soon, and I hope to be a contributor to the revolution we are reaching.

                            This is the second assignment in my CSC108 class. This assignment had two parts, the first part was used to check very basic DNA information. 
				The second part of the assignment was used to check for various palindromic properties, such as the simple palindrome check, as well as the
				more advanced palindromic phrase which is used to check if an entire phrase, regardless of white space, is a palindrome. There was also the 
				odd palindrome which, given a string and an index, checks the longest palindrome that can be made centred at the specific index in the string.

                      		This assignment was made by Professor Andrew Petersen at the height of the Presidential Election in the United States of America during late 2016. In this project,
				 we were tasked with processing lots of text files, containing "tweets" from candidates. In the repo various example files can be found. 
				 The tweets that were submitted followed a general format, and introduced to basic data mining from text files. The project also contains various helper functions for 
				processing tweets and extracting specific items from tweets.

				and were expected to have our source files be able to be interchanged with theirs and vice versa. This meaning that we implemented according to their specific requirements.
